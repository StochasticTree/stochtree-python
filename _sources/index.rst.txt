StochTree
=========

``stochtree`` runs stochastic machine learning algorithms for supervised learning and causal inference.
For details on installing the package, see the :doc:`Installation <install>` page. Once you have ``stochtree`` installed, 
the :doc:`Supervised Learning <supervised>` and :doc:`Causal Inference <causal>` vignettes provide some guidance on 
using the package for your use case.

.. We also support a lower-level interface to the underlying C++ data structures which can allow for custom sampling routines 
.. (i.e. interspersing a BART forest with a neural network, a complicated variance sampler, etc...). This interface is introduced 
.. in the :doc:`Prototype <prototype>` vignette.

For complete function / class documentation, see the :doc:`API <api>` page.
